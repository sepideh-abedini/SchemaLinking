# Prompt For Step One
QUERY_REWRITING_TEMPLATE = """You are a database semantic architect. Given a user question and partial schema context, systematically perform schema adequacy analysis and question re-engineering through these phases:
# Phase 1: Structural Necessity Analysis
A) Entity-Relationship Identification:
- Identify explicit/nascent entities (Subject: <entity>, Measurement: <metric>, Context: <domain>)
- Map to required schema components: 
a. Core tables (1 per entity) 
b. Attribute columns (2-5 per entity) 
c. Temporal anchors (DATE-type columns)
d. Relationship connectors (FK chains)

B) Gap Detection Matrix:
1. Verify existence per entity:
   - Mandatory: Primary table with PK;
   - Operational: Columns for filtering/aggregation;
   - Temporal: Valid time dimension for range queries;
   - Relational: Connected via FK path to relevant tables.
2. Flag missing components as [UNRESOLVED: component_type].

# Phase 2: Contextual Re-alignment**
A) Semantic Binding Process:
1. Maintain original lexical anchors (technical nouns/verbs)
2. Inject missing elements using schema-adaptive phrasing:
   - Tables: "using <added>table_X</added> containing [entity] records"
   - Columns: "tracking <added>column_Y</added> for [function]"
   - Temporal: "between [start] and [end] in <added>time_column</added>"
   - Relationships: "connected through <added>FK_relationship</added>"

B) Query Intent Preservation Check:
- Ensure rewritten question requires ALL identified [UNRESOLVED] components
- Verify no new assumptions beyond original intent

# Phase 3: Precision Output Formatting**
Structured as:
"In a system tracking [core entities], how to [action verb] <added>using [missing_tables]</added>? Analyze [base_metrics] with <added>[missing_columns]</added> for [operations], filtered through [time_constraints] and correlated via <added>[missing_relationships]</added>."

1. Mandatory <added> tags ONLY for schema additions

3. Output EXCLUSIVELY the reformulated question
4. Strict JSON avoidance

# Prompt For Step Two (Single-DB)
LOCATE_TEMPLATE = """### [Role]
You are a highly experienced database scientist and data analyst with deep expertise in database theory, SQL specifications, and rigorous data validation techniques. Your task is to filter out tables and columns from the given database schema that are completely irrelevant to constructing correct SQL statements derived from a natural language query.

### [Process Guidance]:
1. Verification of Relevance:
(a) Irrelevance Assurance: Confirm that each field (table column) removed is 100% irrelevant to the natural language question and does not affect the final SQL statement.
(b) Prevent False Negatives: Adopt a conservative approach that always prioritizes retaining any elements that might have an implicit connection to the query context.

2.Rigorous Analysis Process:
(a) Context Binding:
# Identify 2-5 primary entities (with any potential aliases or variants).
# Detect hidden constraints such as temporal windows, spatial boundaries, and aggregation needs from the query.
(b) Adaptive Filtering:
# Conservative Exclusion:
- Remove a field only if there is complete lexical isolation (no partial or semantic match with the query tokens, considering case-insensitive comparisons and domain-specific ontologies).
- Exclude a table or column if it lacks any join path (within 3 hops) to the identified primary entities or relevant operational context.
- Discard fields where there is a definitive type contradiction or proven cardinality mismatch.
# Relevance Tagging:
- Instead of immediate removal, flag fields as potential low-usage candidates, legacy context elements, or system artifacts if they require further review.

3. Mandatory Retention Rules:
(a) Retain all primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) fields, including their composite counterparts and any column that participates in multiple join conditions.
(b) Ensure that all numeric, temporal, or geometric fields—especially those related to the query’s implicit domains—are maintained.

4. Final Validation Steps:
(a) Verify that every core entity table still maintains its essential join paths.
(b) Confirm that no critical numeric or temporal fields have been inadvertently removed.
(b) Achieve an efficient yet accurate reduction of schema noise (targeting around 40-70% reduction) without compromising SQL-critical elements or introducing errors.

### [Output Requirements]
After performing the schema pruning and validation steps, compile your final decision into a single Python list. This list must contain all the irrelevant fields agreed upon, where each entry is formatted as [<table>.<column>] (e.g., ['users.age', 'orders.discount_code', 'products.supplier_id']). Do not include any additional text or commentary in the output.

Question: Find the semester when both Master students and Bachelor students got enrolled in.
Analysis: Let's think step by step to determine the exact database corresponding to the question by using the provided database schemas.
Step 1: Key Requirements of the Question.We are tasked with finding the semester when both Master students and Bachelor students got enrolled.This implies that we need data about students' enrollments (Bachelor and Master), and semester information.
Step 2: Database Schemas Comparison.The student_transcripts_tracking schema directly links students to their degree programs and specific semesters. This schema allows us to distinguish between Bachelor's and Master's students, and the presence of the Semesters table enables precise filtering of enrollment data by semester, making it ideal for identifying when both groups were enrolled.The csu_1 schema lacks the necessary granularity for this query. It does not provide detailed semester data or a way to directly link students to their program type (Bachelor's or Master's). While it offers some aggregate enrollment information, it does not enable filtering based on specific semesters, making it insufficient for answering the query about when both Bachelor’s and Master’s students were enrolled together in a semester.
Step 3: Conclusion.The gold database is student_transcripts_tracking because it contains the required detailed data to answer the query about semester enrollments for both Master and Bachelor students.
Database Name: student_transcripts_tracking

        FOREIGN KEY(rating_id) REFERENCES ratings (rating_id), 
        FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES ratings_users (user_id)
)
Question: Which year has the least number of movies that was released and what is the title of the movie in that year that has the highest number of rating score of 1?
Hint: least number of movies refers to MIN(movie_release_year); highest rating score refers to MAX(SUM(movie_id) where rating_score = '1')
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"Which year" so we need column = [movies.movie_release_year]
"number of movies" so we need column = [movies.movie_id]
"title of the movie" so we need column = [movies.movie_title]
"rating score" so we need column = [ratings.rating_score]
Hint also refers to the columns = [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_id, ratings.rating_score]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1]. So the Schema_links are:
Answer: [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_title, ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_id,ratings.movie_id]

Question: Among the lists created by user 4208563, which one has the highest number of followers? Indicate how many followers it has and whether the user was a subscriber or not when he created the list.
Hint: User 4208563 refers to user_id;highest number of followers refers to MAX(list_followers); user_subscriber = 1 means that the user was a subscriber when he created the list; user_subscriber = 0 means the user was not a subscriber when he created the list (to replace)
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"user" so we need column = [lists_users.user_id]
"number of followers" so we need column = [lists.list_followers]
"user was a subscriber or not" so we need column = [lists_users.user_subscriber]
